# Castlehold — fresh install

`Castlehold-Fresh-Install.zip` contains the complete Stone & Steel 0.5.0 source project, all game assets, tests and the Android build workflow. It can be extracted into an empty repository. Earlier Castlehold files are not required.

Included: 100 nonstop waves, boss encounters every 20 waves, medieval defenders, the orc/ogre horde, detailed brown castle masonry, stronger enemy attacks, louder character defeat voices, 1×/2×/3× battle speed, adjustable medieval music, pause, recruitment, repairs and finger scouting.

## 1. Create the repository

Create a **new GitHub repository**, for example `Castlehold-Fresh`. Enable **Add a README file** and use the `main` branch. Upload `Castlehold-Fresh-Install.zip` into that repository's root and commit the upload. Open a Codespace for this new repository.

Keep the downloaded ZIP's name exactly as shown. If the phone adds a suffix such as `(1)`, rename the upload to `Castlehold-Fresh-Install.zip` before continuing.

## 2. Paste into the Codespaces terminal

```bash
git pull --ff-only &&
unzip -o Castlehold-Fresh-Install.zip &&
git add project tests docs tools .github README.md FRESH_INSTALL.md GDD.md CHARACTER_ART_BIBLE.md BALANCE.md ANDROID_BUILD.md ASSET_LICENSES.md .gitignore &&
git commit -m "Install complete Castlehold game" &&
git push
```

The archive places `project`, `tools`, `tests`, `docs` and the workflow directly at repository root. No folder moves, old update ZIPs, local Godot install or manual Android setup are needed in Codespaces. The commands stop if a step fails.

## 3. Download the Android build

Open **Actions → Build Castlehold Android**. Select the run named **Install complete Castlehold game**. After it succeeds, download **Castlehold-Android-debug**, extract the artifact ZIP and install `Castlehold-debug.apk` on the phone.

Uploading the source ZIP alone does not start the game build in an empty repository. The source commit above installs the workflow and triggers it.

If a build fails, open the failed job and expand its red step to see the specific error. The generic exit-code line alone does not identify the cause.

## Existing Android installation

This package retains the app ID `com.castlehold.firststand`. The workflow currently generates a debug signing key on each run. If Android rejects installation over the older app because its signature differs, uninstall the older Castlehold and install the new APK. **Uninstalling removes its saved progress.** Creating a new GitHub repository by itself does not reset the installed phone app.

This is a complete source package. GitHub Actions builds the APK using Godot 4.7.2. Current gameplay validation is in `docs/VALIDATION.md`; physical Android graphics, sound and performance still require device review.
